Use `Badge` to create a small element that is rendered inline with a label or on the corner of another element.

```tsx
<Badge count={23}>new</Badge>
<Badge count={2}>
  <IconChatBubble />
</Badge>
```

## API

If a string is passed as the child for the `Badge` component, the text will be rendered inside of the badge.

If a React component is passed as the child of `Badge`, the badge will be rendered in the top-right corner of the child component.
