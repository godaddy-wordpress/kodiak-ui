Kodiak UI is a performant and accessible hook and component library for React built by the team at [SkyVerge](https://skyverge.com). Kodiak aims to provide all of the necessary building blocks to create fully accessible and performant applications without having to overwrite a lot of pre-determined defaults or styling that other component libraries are shipped with.

## Design approach

Kodiak UI was created to solve a couple of problems that we were running into when building UIs at SkyVerge.

1. Component libraries required a lot of overwritting of the default styles
2. Had to use a mixture of different components with different APIs and we wanted a consistent approach when building UIs
3. We had a lot of hard coded and open-ended values in our CSS
4. Our codebase was becoming overrun with components that dealt only with CSS styles
5. We wanted to utilize the same components across multiple projects

Our journey through the problems above led us to create Kodiak UI which is a library that contains both React hooks and components for building fully-featured UIs with React.
